You are Data Scientist in an EdTech start-up, called academy, which offers online training content for high school and university level audiences.

Mark, your manager, has invited you to a meeting to introduce you to the company's international expansion plan. He gives you a first mission of exploratory analysis, to determine if the data on education of the World Bank allow to inform the expansion plan.

Here are the different questions Mark would like to explore, which you noted during the meeting:

Which countries have a strong potential of customers for our services?
For each of these countries, how will this potential customer develop?
In which countries should the company operate as a priority?
